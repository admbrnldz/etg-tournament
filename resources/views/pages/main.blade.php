            <p class="lead">Imagine the existence of a time machine that could instantly transport you 130,000 years into the past. But what exactly would you see when you take your first step outside the time machine? You would bear witness to the event to which we all thank our lives; The great confrontation between Homo Sapiens and Homo Erectus. The confrontation 130,000 years ago greatly influenced our destiny. In the end, we, the Homo Sapiens just barely made it. If we hadn't, the world would have looked entirely different.</p>

              <p class="lead">
              The game is about building and expanding your empire in a pre-historic world that existed 130,000 years ago. Back then Homo sapiens weren’t alone on this planet. Next to Homo sapiens there was also another type of humans, called Homo erectus. Where the development of the Homo sapiens was mainly technology driven, the development of the Homo erectus was based on a symbiosis with nature. The Homo erectus worked together with animals and lived on our planet for 1.5 million years.
              In the game, you play as a white, brown, black or yellow individual of the Homo sapiens. Together with thousands of other players, you explore the dynamics of working together, trading and forming alliances. The common enemy that you encounter in the game, is the Erectus people.
